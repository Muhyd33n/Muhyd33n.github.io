220941967,1/30/2017,"At 8:45 a.m. on January 30, 2017, a truck driver delivered a JLG Telehandler to a rental company. The JLG was on a step-deck trailer. A step-deck trailer has an upper deck on the front of the trailer then steps down to a lower level which allows multiple loads of cargo. The forks on the telehandler were folded under, and work-light support brackets located on the left and right side of the telehandler so the machine could be as far forward as possible against the step. The driver backed the rear of his trailer against the offloading platform located in the yard. The off-loading/loading ramp was a twenty five foot triangle shaped ramp with expanded metal on the ramp for traction. On the upper left and right side of the ramp were two chains that attached to the trailer of the truck to prevent a gap from occurring between the trunk and ramp. The driver put on his hard hat and exited the truck cab in order to remove the chains and binders holding the piece of equipment on the trailer. An employee of the rental company told the truck driver to say out of the way as he backed the machine off the trailer. The rental company employee got into the JLG Telehandler to back it off the trailer. The JLG Telehandler operator sits on the left side and the operator's view is partially obstructed by the boom and engine. The JLG telehandler is slightly smaller in width than the ramp so the rental company employee was carefully watching his placement on the ramp as he was backing up. Once the rear wheels of the machine were on the ground the carriage was dragging the ground so the rental company employee raised the carriage just enough to keep it from dragging. At this time, the machine engaged its auto-leveling system. The auto-leveling system on board the equipment self-adjusts to keep the carriage and the forks in a flat position. When this system operated, the forks, which were still tucked under the work-lights, rose upward slightly and put pressure on the bottom of the work lights. As a result, the pressure on the work-lights caused the lights to be sheared off the brackets and flung into the air. The truck driver was standing on the passenger side of the trailer about half way down and was struck in the face with the lights. The rental company employee who was operating the JLG Telehandler saw the truck driver fall off the loading dock.

The employees had placed their rigging at the quarter points from the girder ends. The girder had been set down on the stands and two bars clamps were used to secure the girder to the stands; one on each stand and on opposite sides of the girder. The employees began unhooking their rigging. The coworker had walked the west crane hoist and rigging down to the west end of the girder after it was unhooked. The employee had unhooked the rigging from the girder and was in the process of raising the crane hoist for the rigging to clear the floor. As the hoist was raised, the hook on the south side of the girder caught the bottom flange, causing the girder to become unbalanced. The girder tipped over and fell, striking the employee. The girder falling created a domino effect with two other girders staged to the north and knocked them off the stands. The employee suffered blunt force trauma to the chest, abdomen and the pelvis and was killed.

There was a controlled access zone along the perimeter of the roof. Because of the compromised condition of the existing roof, employees were required to be 100% tied off, even while working within the controlled access zone. The existing roof was comprised of three layers. The bottom layer consisted of gypsum board, which was covered by an asphalt membrane. The asphalt membrane was then covered with gravel. The employer was ripping up the old decking and replacing it with wood decking boards. Employee #1 used a wheelbarrow to transport trash to the edge of the building so it could be dumped in the dumpster below. He did this approximately 15 times that day. The edge of the building was located approximately 17.5 ft away from a fall protection cart that he was tied off to. He had not adjusted the slack in his life line because he was rushing to get his work done and he felt that he could work faster if he didn't adjust the slack. The foreman removed some old decking and instructed Employee #1 to bring the wheel barrow over to collect the debris that was created during the removal. The fall protection cart was located approximately 3.5 ft from the hole that was created by the removal of the old roofing structure. Employee #1 was unaware of, and did not see, the approximately 2 ft wide by 6 ft long hole created by the removal of the old decking. As a result, he fell through the hole and landed on the concrete floor, falling approximately 15.33 ft. Employee #1 suffered multiple injuries in the fall, including a fractured right wrist, bruised knees, damaged back, jaw pain. Employee #1 was transported to a medical center, where he received treatment and was hospitalized.

220920839,1/9/2017,"At 8:50 a.m. on January 9, 2017, an employee was working for a firm that wholesaled recyclable materials. The employer bought and sold scrap metals and other items in southern California. The facility where the employee worked was a large commercial open or outdoor yard. It had a receiving area where pieces of metal scrap from the petrochemical and other industries were brought in and processed. The facility also had an office building and an indoor machine shop shed area. The employee was working as a permanent, full-time employee at the time of the incident. The yard supervisor, who was also the employee's immediate supervisor, was at the yard at the time of the incident. The employee was using a Victor oxygen and propane gas open flame cutting torch. It was attached to a 22.8-meter (75-foot) hose line, color-coded red for fuel and green for oxygen. He was in an outdoor area, in the northeast part of the yard facility. Immediately prior to the incident, the employee had torch-cut several metal pipes lying in the area. He then began cutting a Hydril pulsation dampener. The spherical pulsation dampener consisted of two sections held together by 36 stud bolts. The employee began torch-cutting along the seam. This action caused the buildup of ignitable or flammable vapors within the dampener. He had cut 12 of the 36 stud bolts, when the dampener exploded. The vapors had caught fire, and the dampener ripped apart along the seam. The employee sustained multiple bodily fractures, a laceration to his abdomen, an injury to his left shoulder, and ruptures in the skin of his left upper and lower leg. The paramedics transported the employee to the medical center, for treatment. Surgeries were performed. Later on, he was hospitalized in Loma Linda University Medical Center, and he was discharged on March 29, 2017. The firm's manager of operations and safety compliance reported the incident to the San Bernardino District Office at 1:10 p.m. on January 9, 2017. The employer reported the serious injury accident in a timely manner and met the Division's reporting requirements. An inspector from the District office arrived at the facility and opened an inspection with the firm's owner and the employer's attorney at approximately 8:45 a.m on January 10, 2017. During the interview, the employee stated that the firm's owner had assigned him the job of torch cutting all materials to be cut, including the pulsation dampener. It was thought that the employer had failed to make certain that the pulsation dampener did not contain any hazardous flammable substance or could build up pressure that would render it unsafe during salvage operations. Such operations would have included open flame torch cutting, crushing, and cutting by shear machines.

The Company's Safety Manager asked the employees to ascend on the swing-stage scaffold to inspect and adjust the I-beam supporting the scaffold system. The Safety Manager made the request after they attempted to move the swing-stage scaffold from the ground and one of the I-beam trolleys being used to support the scaffold system and lifelines became stuck.   The I-beam supporting the swing-stage scaffold was part of a High Bay Pallet Storage (HBPS) system upper guide rail. The upper guide rail supporting the swing-stage scaffold was designed to keep the HBPS system crane plumbed during operation and not designed as a load bearing I-beam. The upper rail was approximately 76 feet, 9 inches above ground level and consisted of sixteen I-beam sections. Trolley anchors were used to connect the Spider swing-stage scaffold system to the I-beam. The upper guide rail I-beam was connected and supported by cross aisle ties (CATs). It was established during the investigation, the weight of the scaffold system and the I-beam exceeded the CAT's maximum intended load capacity. At the time of the accident, the upper guide rail (I-beam) sections were not connected and had visible gaps between the rail joints. The Safety Manager and scaffold competent person did not perform a visual inspection of the upper guide rail prior to using the scaffold. The rail sections gap increased as a result of the CAT deflection due to the imposed load. The gaps allowed three (3) I-beam rollers to roll off the I-beam causing the employee to fall approximately 40 feet to the next lower level. The employee received multiple internal injuries resulting from a forty (40) foot fall and being struck by the swing-stage scaffold which also fell from a height of approximately forty (40) feet, and was killed.

Local rescue personnel were called and took over first aid upon arrival and removed employee #1. In the main electrical panel for the rip saw, 2 of 3 fuses tripped. The third fuse did not trip because the surge of electricity caused the contact inside the panel to weld itself open. The lifting table was equipped with a flexible power cord which was connected to a receptacle located on a power box which was fixed to the frame of the gang rip saw. The grounding wire located inside the receptacle was covered in insulation where it was attached to the grounding lug; thus rendering the ground wire ineffective. Further review of the power cord revealed the cord had seven areas of damage to the sheath and insulation, including two complete breaks which were spliced together and then covered by electrical tape. Damage to the flexible cord allowed the copper wiring contained in the cord to make contact with the lifting table, resulting in the table becoming energized.
